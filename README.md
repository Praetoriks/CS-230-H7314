1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room Client is a client that already has their foot in the door. They have a product that already exists, is playable, and is producing monetary value. They, however, want to create a web-based game that serves multiple platforms which is based on their already existing game which only exists on Android devices.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe the section I did particularly well was the first 3rd. I believe I set up a mildly competent summary of the project and what it would entail, as well as a UML diagram that set it up in a more visual standard.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I find it a lot easier to develop the code when I had something to base it off of. Instead of working from scratch and trying to figure out how everything fit together, I could leave the conceptualization to the sheet and simply made it functional on the backend.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I did not get to work on the 2nd half due to a health issue so that is the section I would choose to revise. Anything at all would be an improvement over the current nothing that exists there.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs were considered throughout the whole document as they were the underlying motivation for this product.  It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are the ones using the product, in the end, the client and the user are the only parts of the equation that actually matter when it comes to producing a product for them.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software in a variety of ways, although mainly I stuck with the concept of  modularity, a method which I would stick to regardless of the project because of its usefulness in adapting to any given situation.
